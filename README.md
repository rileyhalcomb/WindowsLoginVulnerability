# Windows 10/11 Login Vulnerability
This README file will go over the steps to accessing data on a computer secured with a password or pin code.

1. First, you will need to get to the login screen.

2. Once there, you need to hold shift and click the restart button. This will take you into the Advanced Startup Options Menu. The computer will restart and show a blue screen with several options.

3. Once you are at the screen with several options, click *__Troubleshoot__*, then click *__Advanced Options__*. You should now see another set of options. Next, click on the *__Command Prompt__* option. If this is not an option, see *__Using Bootable Drive to Change Passwords__*.

4. Once in the Command Prompt, you will be changing the directory to where Windows system applications are locateed. First, type ```C:``` and press Enter. Then, use ```dir``` to check if the drive selected (C:) has Windows files on it. If so, navigate to the System32 directory by typing ```cd Windows\System32```. If not, or if typing in ```C:``` gives an error, keep searching for a drive letter that has Windows folders on it (e.g., *__Program Files, Users, Windows__*).

5. Once in the ```System32``` directory, you will be renaming Windows applications, specifically the __Command Prompt__ and __Accessibility__ programs. The two names for these programs are ```cmd.exe``` and ```utilman.exe```. In order to rename these programs, first type ```ren utilman.exe utilman1.exe```, which will rename the Accessibility program to a different name. Then, type ```ren cmd.exe utilman.exe```, which will rename the Command Prompt to the Accessibility program's original name. By doing this, you have swapped out what applications will run at the login screen.

6. Close the Command Prompt, and click *__Continue__*. This will take you to the regular login page.

7. Click on the Accessibiliy icon in the bottom-right, next to the power button. This will open up the Command Prompt.

8. From here, you will either be resetting the password of a current user (preferably an Admin user), or creating another Admin user. If you know that the user does not have a Microsoft account, proceed to Step 9, otherwise, proceed to step 10.

9. Type ```net user``` to see the different users on the system, and type ```net user username *```, replacing "username" with the name of the user that you are currently trying to reset the password for. This command will ask for a password that you may set if you like. Otherwise, you can leave it blank, press *__Enter__* twice, and remove the password entirely. If this works, close the Command Prompt and attempt to login. If not, proceed to the next step.

11. In case of the previous step not succeeding or the user having a Microsoft account, you will add another Admin user to the system. In the Command Prompt, type ```net user account_name /add```, with "account_name" being replaced with the name of your choice. This command adds a user to the list of users. Next you will add this newly-created user to the Administrators group. Type ```net localgroup administrators account_name /add```, with the "account_name" once again being the name of your choice created earlier. This command will make the newly-created user an Adminstrator and give the account all the Admin privileges.

12. Next, you will have to restart the system in order for the new user to show up. Once the computer gets to the login page, you should be able to select your new user in the bottom-left corner and login. After logging in, you may delete any other accounts on the system and access all files on the system.
