# Windows 10/11 Login Vulnerability
This README file will go over the steps to accessing data on a computer secured with a password or pin code.

1. First, you will need to get to the login screen.

2. Once there, you need to hold shift and click the restart button. This will take you into the Advanced Startup Options Menu. The computer will restart and show a blue screen with several options.

3. Once you are at the screen with several options, click *__Troubleshoot__*, then click *__Advanced Options__*. You should now see another set of options. Next, click on the *__Command Prompt__* option.

4. Once in the Command Prompt, you will be changing the directory to where Windows system applications are locateed. First, type ```C:``` and press Enter. Then, use ```dir``` to check if the drive selected (C:) has Windows files on it. If so, navigate to the System32 directory by typing ```cd Windows\System32```. If not, or if typing in *C:* gives an error, keep searching for a drive letter that has Windows folders on it (e.g., *Program Files, Users, Windows*).

5. Once in the *System32* directory, you will be renaming Windows applications, specifically the Command Prompt and Accessibility programs. The two names for these programs are *__cmd.exe__* and *__utilman.exe__*. In order to rename these programs, first type ```ren utilman.exe utilman1.exe```, which will rename the Accessibility program to a different name. Then, type ```ren cmd.exe utilman.exe```, which will rename the Command Prompt to the Accessibility program's original name. By doing this, you have swapped out what applications will run at the login screen.
