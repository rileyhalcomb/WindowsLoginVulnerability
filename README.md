# Windows 10/11 Login Vulnerability
This README file will go over the steps to accessing data on a computer secured with a password or pin code.

First, you will need to get to the login screen.

Once there, you need to hold shift and click the restart button. This will take you into the Advanced Startup Options Menu. The computer will restart and show a blue screen with several options.

Once you are at the screen with several options, click *__Troubleshoot__*, then click *__Advanced Options__*.
